### Hi there, I'm EssKayz!

<p>I'm relatively sane as a person - but don't quote me on that.</p>
<p>I've been lucky enough to work within a plethora of different roles during my lifetime, which have all formed who I am as a developer and how I like to work.</p>
<p>I'm very passionate about system desgin, database design and generic full-stack development.</p>
<p>On my spare time, I like to fiddle around with new technologies to try to create small pieces of software to help with my daily life, mostly in very very private repositories to hide my shame <3 </p>

<p>During my adventure through life, I've been lucky (?) enough to get to use with many technologies, libraries and softwares, which of the following are probably the most relevant to mention: </p>
